Citrix ADC CPX can act as a sidecar proxy to an application container in Istio. You can inject the Citrix ADC CPX manually or automatically using the Istio sidecar injector. Automatic sidecar injection requires resources including a Kubernetes mutating webhook admission controller, and a service. Using this Helm chart, you can create resources required for automatically deploying Citrix ADC CPX as a sidecar proxy.
